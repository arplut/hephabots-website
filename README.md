# Hephabots preview landing

This repository contains the Hephabots preview landing site. It was originally bootstrapped from a third-party prototyping tool; references to that tool have been removed.

## Local development

Requirements: Node.js and npm/yarn.

Install dependencies and start dev server:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages (project site)

1. Build the project: `npm run build`.
2. Commit the `dist` (or `build`) output to the `gh-pages` branch, or use an action to publish the `build` output to GitHub Pages.

If you want, I can add a GitHub Action workflow to automate publishing to GitHub Pages.
